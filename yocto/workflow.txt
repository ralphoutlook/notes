Developing a Board Support Package (BSP)
- Set up your host development system to support development using the Yocto Project
- Establish a local copy of the project files on your system
- Establish the meta-intel repository on your system
- Create your own BSP layer using the yocto-bsp script
- Make configuration changes to your new BSP layer
- Make recipe changes to your new BSP layer
- Prepare for the build
- Build the image

Set up your host development system to support development using the Yocto Project (Ubuntu and Debian)
- Essentials: Packages needed to build an image on a headless system:
     $ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
     build-essential chrpath socat

     $ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev xterm
- Documentation: Packages needed if you are going to build out the Yocto Project documentation manuals:
     $ sudo apt-get install make xsltproc docbook-utils fop dblatex xmlto
- SDK Installer Extras: Packages needed if you are going to be using the the standard or extensible SDK:
     $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool libglib2.0-dev libarchive-dev
